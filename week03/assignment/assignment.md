## Assignment Content

- Configure a GitHub account w/ your UMBC email (if you don't have one). 
- Create repository to warehouse homeworks and projects for the first of the class. 
- Pick a dataset (not in the book or a common toy example) that you'll eventually want to use for a regression problem. 
- Perform EDA on that dataset in a Jupyter Notebook and post to Github. It should include information on the dataset, what question you eventually want to answer. Graphs and tables should be well labeled and "professional" quality. It should fully explore the dataset and provide the reader with all the high points regarding potential predictors and patterns in the data.
In addition to code and output, include written descriptions of what you can see. This should be clear, considering, and use proper grammar.

Rubric:
(10%) GitHub repository for DATA602 created and folder for assignment 3 created
Within assignment 3 folder there should be a folder for the data used (with the data included therein), an executed Jupyter Notebook, and a readme file with the data and project description.
(10%) Jupyter Notebook
Markdown cells properly formatted. Major steps in the analysis should be described in the markdown and results should be discussed immediately after the code block.
All code blocks have output below - no errors or cells that weren’t executed.
Narratives are properly formatted, with correct grammar and punctuation.
(10%) Output of professional quality
Charts properly labeled (axis labels, titles, …)
(70%) Completeness of exploratory analysis
(5%) Discussion of business question / objective that is being analyzed
(5%) Profiling of data (observations, missing values, data types)
(10%) Relevant categorical variables analyzed, and cleaned, if necessary.
(10%) Numerical variables analyzed (distributions, five number summary, …)
(30%) Exploration of relationships between key categorical and numerical variables
(10%) Discussion of what you have observed throughout your analysis
I should be able to walk away with a through outstanding of the dataset you’ve chosen
