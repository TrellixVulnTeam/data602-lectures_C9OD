# DATA602 Final Project
This is your opportunity to utilize the concepts in the course in undertaking your own machine learning analysis. This will be worth 30% of your final grade.

# Deliverables:
### (1) A GitHub repository with your project, containing:
- README that contains an overview of your work. 
- Copy or link to your data. 
- Jupyter Notebook - containing:  
  - an abstract/introduction;   
  - exploratory data analysis);  
  - data cleaning and feature engineering;  
  - modeling;  
  - results and discussion;  
  - conclusion/next steps;  
  - references. 
### (2) Slide presentation that summarizes your motivation for choosing the dataset, the specific problem you are trying to solve, exploratory data analysis, and model results. You should include motivation towards the techniques chosen and areas for further exploration. Time permitting in the last week, everyone will have ~5 minutes to present their projects.
### (3) Youtube recording (< 5 minutes) overviewing the slides. Youâ€™ll submit the link.

# Grading Guidelines:
- ( 5%) Project motivation clearly explained. 
- ( 5%) Dataset is suitable and is within the below requirements. 
- (15%) Exploratory analysis clearly presented with professional/publication quality graphics. 
- (15%) Feature engineering steps clearly explained. 
- (10%) Proper splitting/partitioning of data to ensure results are robust. 
- (20%) Fitting of several models and exploration of different hyperparameters. 
- (10%) Discussion of machine learning models chosen for exploration. For those chosen, detail on why the final hyperparameters were chosen.  
- (10%) Visualizations on model results and clear explanation on the final model.  
- ( 5%) Slides overview the project, results, and conclusions. Include necessary exhibits/text.  
- ( 5%)The video clip (of reasonable audio quality) that walks through the entirety of your analysis.  
- Additional consideration will be given to participation during the in-class presentations for volunteering to present your project and for participating in discussions.  

# Data requirements:
- Should not be one of the common machine learning datasets used in examples and textbooks (no titanic, MNIST, iris, Boston house prices, or textbook datasets).
Use a dataset of at least moderate size (> 5,000 rows and 10 features). Ideally, the dataset should have a mix of numerical and categorical features, but that is not mandatory. If the dataset comes from Kaggle or Data.World, there should be no public notebooks with analysis.  
- The dataset should not be proprietary or internal to your company. Look for open data sets.  
- This should be a **CLASSIFICATION** problem, either binary or multi-class.  
- Data sets used in class are obvious not allowed, this includes the IMDb dataset, MNIST, and other data sets we used in class.

# Deadline:
- Links to GitHub repository, slides, and YouTube video must be submitted via Blackboard by December 6th, 2021 at 11:59PM.  

# Potential projects:  
- Sentiment analysis of review data to predict user reviews, whether an individual purchased a product, ...  
- Image classification, e.g., predicted whether a picture is a dog, cat, fish, ...
